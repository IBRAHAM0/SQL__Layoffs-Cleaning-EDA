# Layoffs Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis in SQL

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the cleaning, analysis, and visualization of layoffs data using SQL to extract actionable insights and identify trends across various industries and regions. The analysis aims to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of layoffs, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning in workforce management. 

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess layoffs data to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights regarding layoffs by company, industry, and region.
- Provide a deeper understanding of factors influencing layoffs, including company size, funding stage, and year-over-year trends.

## Key Tasks

### A) **Data Cleaning**
- **Remove Duplicates and Redundant Data**: Identified and eliminated duplicate entries to ensure dataset accuracy.
- **Standardize Formats**: Ensured uniform data formatting (e.g., date formats, text casing) to maintain consistency across the dataset.
- **Handle Null/Blank Values**: Imputed or removed null and blank values based on data relevance and context to prevent skewed analysis.

### B) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Layoffs by Company**: Identified companies with the highest total layoffs and the highest percentage of layoffs within their workforce.
- **Industry & Country Trends**: Analyzed layoffs by industry and country, identifying the regions with the most significant impact.
- **Top Industries & Countries**: Evaluated the top 5 industries and countries by percentage of layoffs to identify sectors and regions most affected by workforce reductions.
- **Yearly and Monthly Layoff Analysis**: Reviewed maximum layoffs by year, funding stage, and month to identify temporal trends and cyclical patterns.
- **Rolling Totals & Averages**: Calculated rolling totals and average percentages of layoffs for individual companies to track long-term trends and workforce reductions.
- **Company Ranking by Layoffs**: Ranked companies with the highest total layoffs over the years, providing insight into long-term patterns.

## Insights & Impact

This analysis provides a holistic view of the layoff trends across various sectors and regions, helping companies and policymakers understand the broader economic and social impact of workforce reductions. The findings can guide future business strategies, talent management policies, and workforce planning.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Identify Critical Trends**: Gain insights into the most affected industries and regions to better understand the impact of economic downturns, global events, and market conditions.
- **Improve Decision-Making**: Enable stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding hiring, workforce adjustments, and company restructuring.
- **Support Workforce Management**: Provide companies with data-driven insights to anticipate layoffs and manage workforce transitions more effectively.
